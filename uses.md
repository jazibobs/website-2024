## Editor / Terminal + Apps

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my text editor for web development
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is my weapon of choice for game development, I think it's because the Node/Scene system has a lot of parallels with the DOM so it logically makes a lot of sense for me.
- [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) most usually running PowerShell 7 but I also have WSL enabled with Ubuntu for when I need to get Linux-y
- I've been building websites using [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) as my development browser of choice for a number of years now.
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) for daily quick communication
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for quick notes, to-dos and general planning for larger projects
