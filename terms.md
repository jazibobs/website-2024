## Session overview

Each Godot tutoring session runs for 60 minutes at the time pre-arranged by the tutor and tutee. The content of the session will be pre-agreed by the tutor and tutee at the time of agreeing the session date and time.

All payments must be made in advance; tutees who have not completed payment will not have access to any tutoring sessions.

Tutees will be given access to the learning materials for each session during or shortly after a session via GitHub.

All tutees are expected to maintain a polite and professional tone. Disruptive or disrespectful behaviour will not be tolerated and may result in removal the termination of the tutoring session without a refund.

Please arrive on time for each session to ensure you get the most out of the hour time slot.

In order to fully engage with the session, tutees are required to have the latest version of Godot installed on their machines, a stable internet connection as well as a camera and microphone.

## Cancellations, rescheduling sessions and refunds

If tutees need to reschedule a session, this can be done free of charge as long as notice is given more than 24 hours prior to the original scheduled time.

To reschedule less than 24 hours before a session is scheduled to start, a £10 administration fee is added.

If a tutee does not attend a session due to illness or other reasons without informing the tutor beforehand, no refund will be given.

If a tutee has booked a group of lessons (i.e. a set of 5 or 10 sessions) and would like a refund for any unused sessions. The remaining sessions will be refunded at a flat rate of £20 per session.

Refunds are not provided for single sessions if the tutee decides they no longer wish to attend.
