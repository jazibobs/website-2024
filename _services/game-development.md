Professional programming support for your game project.

I'm currently accepting projects supporting indie teams building games with the Godot engine.

I have 10+ years of software development experience and have been building games in Godot for the last 3 years. Recently, I've been working on the adventure/puzzle game Mithra. Prior to that, I helped to design and deliver the Godot game development modules at Dulwich College Beijing.

Whether you're looking to develop an early prototype, refine an existing game project, or create a full experience from start to finish. I can help you to build experiences that will delight your players.

Send an email to [talk@jaredrigby.co.uk](mailto:talk@jaredrigby.co.uk) if you're looking for support in a new Godot project.
