Learn to code from a professional teacher.

I am a fully qualified UK teacher (PGCE) and hold a Masters Degree (MSc) in computer science. I was the lead teacher of game development at Dulwich College Beijing, I run a freelance software studio specialising in Godot development and have been running an annual game development competition in collaboration with Ubisoft Shanghai since 2022.

If you are looking to get started with the Godot engine, I'm not offering 1-to-1 tutoring sessions to help you get to grips with the engine.

Prior to each session, the learning materials will be pre-agreed to ensure that you are meeting your learning goals. Depending on your level of familiarity, we will cover beginner, intermediate or advanced topics on Godot.
