Learn to code a with a qualified computer science teacher.

If you are looking to get started with the Godot engine, I'm offering personalised 1-to-1 tutoring sessions to help you get to grips with building games in Godot.

Whether you're a complete beginner, have dabbled in other engines before or want to push forwards into advanced topics. I can support you on your Godot journey.

Prior to each session, we will pre-agree on the lesson topic and outcomes to ensure that you are meeting your learning goals.

I have worked as a computer science teacher at world leading international schools. In my most recent post, I was the lead teacher of all game development modules at Dulwich College Beijing.

I run a freelance software development studio specialising in Godot development and have been running an annual game development competition in collaboration with Ubisoft Shanghai since 2022.
