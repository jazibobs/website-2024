And now for something completely different, only taking 4 commands to get up and running (assuming you have ruby and rubygems installed on your system of course).

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll new jaredrigby
$ cd jaredrigby
~/jaredrigby $ jekyll serve

# local jekyll site running on localhost:4000
{% endhighlight %}

Today marks the first time I've built a site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (I know I'm about 3 years late to the party) and I have to say it's been a pleasure.

Having an in-built SASS compiler greatly reduces the set up time required for build processes - I completely omitted my build tools from this project - and being able to mark up template designs without the ugliness of PHP and the WordPress loop can only be positive.

Admittedly, Jekyll does seem to have a limited number applications. The only one that comes to mind is a blog for a web developer due to it depending on creating/editing markdown files rather than using a traditional CMS.

Even so, I'm excited to learn more about the Jekyll platform and extend the functionality of the site as I create and edit more content for it.

You can follow the development of this site on [Github](https://github.com/jazibobs/jazibobs.github.io).
