This is my fifth post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 41 to 50.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 41 - 11 Mar 2022

I started this section of the challenge by completing the fifth and final D3.js challenge on freeCodeCamp to earn my [Data Visualisation Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jazibobs/data-visualization)

Spent the day working on my personal website to catalogue what I had achieved during days 31 to 40.

### Day 43 - 13 Mar 2022

I made a start on the information security path on freeCodeCamp. I set up a Node.js environment locally and on Heroku in order to learn more about securing Express.js applications using Helmet.

### Day 44 - 14 Mar 2022

Continuing with the freeCodeCamp information security path, I was able to add XSS filtering, HTTPS only headers and cache control to a Express.js application using Helmet.

### Day 45 - 15 Mar 2022

I completed all of the Express.js related challenges on freeCodeCamp's information security learning path. Tomorrow I'll make a start learning about PenTesting tools with Python.

### Day 46 - 16 Mar 2022

Completed all of the Python PenTesting challenges on freeCodeCamp. I learnt about building a TCP client with Python, developed my own nmap scanner and built a port scanner.

### Day 47 - 17 Mar 2022

Before making a start on the freeCodeCamp challenges for information security, I had a look at a few of the Linux challenges on [OverTheWire.org](https://www.overthewire.org). I got as far as bandit13 on the site. Still a ways to go to get to level 34, I'll have to come back to this!

### Day 48 - 18 Mar 2022

Made a start on the first information security project challenge on freeCodeCamp. Created a new Heroku deployment for an Express.js stock checking web app which I'll need to build and deploy.

[The GitHub repository for this project can be found here](https://github.com/jazibobs/boilerplate-project-stockchecker).

### Day 49 - 19 Mar 2022

Continued work on my stock checking project, I'm now able to return real time data about stocks listed on the NYSE. The next step will be to add a database to this system so I'm able to track user's favourite stocks to pass the freeCodeCamp project assignment.

### Day 50 - 20 Mar 2022

Lazy Sunday, spent some time updating this website with my progress over days 41 to 50.
