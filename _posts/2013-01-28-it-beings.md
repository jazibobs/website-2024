*Author's note - kept for nostalgia*

Today sees the launch of jaredrigby.co.uk. My personal site powered by a Raspberry Pi!

The site will act as a development portfolio of sorts and also an opportunity for me to share what I'm currently coding as professional work or what I've made as a personal project.

Everything you see is brand new and coded by hand in Notepad++ so please bear with me while I go over the site with a fine tooth comb ensuring that every link works as expected etc...

I can't wait to start sharing what I'm up to!

Until next time, 

Jared.
