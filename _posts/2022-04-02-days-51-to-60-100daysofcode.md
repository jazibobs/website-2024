This is my sixth post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 51 to 60.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 51 - 21 Mar 2022

Started looking ahead towards [Ludum Dare 50](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50) which will be happening towards the end of the month. I spend some time reviewing Unity as I try to decide to build a Unity or Godot project.

### Day 52 - 22 Mar 2022

Spent a bit of time working through the information security challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Quickly realising I need to relearn at lot of NoSQL.

### Day 53 - 23 Mar 2022

Set up my stock prize checking project for FreeCodeCamp. After some review I've successfully got my project playing nicely with MongoDB Atlus and Mongoose for data modelling.

### Day 54 - 24 Mar 2022

Had a look at some WordPress development today. First time in around 5 years that I've worked with the platform. Happy to see that [VVV](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) is still up and running to generate development environments quickly.

### Day 55 - 25 Mar 2022

WordPress theme development was the order of the day. More specifically, trying to get my head around building themes for their new(ish) block-based editor.

### Day 56 - 26 Mar 2022

Continued working with WordPress. After getting a bare-bones site I was happy with, I took some time to set up my deployment workflows.

### Day 57 - 27 Mar 2022

Went back to the FreeCodeCamp stock checker project after a few days. I created the required API end points and secured them using Helmet.js

### Day 58 - 28 Mar 2022

Created a new Godot project to use as my entry into this year's Lurum Dare 50 game jam. The theme of the competition is "Delay the inevitable".

### Day 59 - 29 Mar 2022

Decided on a concept of my game jam project. I'm creating my first ever match-3 puzzle game! Spend some time watching Godot tutorials to get my brain back into game dev mode.

### Day 60 - 30 Mar 2022

Continued to work on my Godot project for Lurum Dare 50, my match-3 game is now able to register colour combinations and automatically refill the board during play.
