This is my seventh post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 61 to 70.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 61 - 31 Mar 2022

Continued work on my [LD50 game Monster Match](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/monster-match), created multiple levels which build in difficulty today.

### Day 65 - 4 Apr 2022

I started work on a new Godot game for Black and White Jam #8. It needs to follow the theme of 'loop' and must be completely monochromatic. My initial thoughts are for an electroplankton-esque puzzle game. We'll have to see how it evolves over the next few days.

### Day 66 - 5 Apr 2022

Spent some time learning about Godot's 2D physics engine for my puzzle game and was also able to create a procedurally updated background track to add some atmosphere to the game.

### Day 67 - 6 Apr 2022

Spent some time adding some more polish to my Godot game, my specific focus for the day was in adding a subtle camera shake effect and some particle effects for visual interest.

### Day 68 - 7 Apr 2022

Further work on my game jam entry for black and white jam #8. Created the main menu and UI systems and actually remembered to link my social media profiles to the credits page!

### Day 69 - 8 Apr 2022

Learnt how to control the Godot audio server using GDScript. Thanks to this, I was able to create an options page for the player to independently select their own audio settings for background music and sound effects.

### Day 70 - 9 Apr 2022

Spent some time updating this website to outline what I've been working on from days 61 to 70.
