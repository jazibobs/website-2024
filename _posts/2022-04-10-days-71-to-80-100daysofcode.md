This is my eighth post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 71 to 80.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 71 - 10 Apr 2022

Spent some time adding Open Graph tags to the Jekyll template that powers this site. From now on, any links shared on social media should be rendered with a lovely preview of the content.

Here's an example from Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Day 71 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a> - Finally got round to adding OpenGraph tags to my personal website. Hopefully the social media previews will be a little bit more beautiful from now on...<a href="https://t.co/TjDsOnr5ZF">https://t.co/TjDsOnr5ZF</a></p>&mdash; Jared Rigby ðŸ’» (@jazibobs) <a href="https://twitter.com/jazibobs/status/1513170846050828291?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

### Day 72 - 11 Apr 2022

Continued work on my project for black and white jam #8. I created my first ever shader script in Godot to make a TV static effect.

All source code for the game can be found here: https://github.com/jazibobs/bwjam8

### Day 73 - 12 Apr 2022

Finished the final touches of my Godot game for black and white jam #8. I have a play with all of the export options available in the engine to create an Android, Windows, Mac and Linux build.

You can play the game here:

### Day 74 - 13 Apr 2022

Staying in the world of Godot, I'm currently trying to learn more about how to build shaders. I was able to develop a simple smoke style effect which I can control the colour of in GDScript.

### Day 75 - 14 Apr 2022

Saw that the Gamedev.js jam has started so I'm going to try out making a small game using Phaser. I saw that [Zenva](https://academy.zenva.com) are sponsoring the competition so I'm going to try out their platform to learn how build JavaScript games.

### Day 76 - 15 Apr 2022

Continuing to learn about the Phaser game engine for JavaScript. I've now learnt how to set up a boilerplate project for Phaser, how to render sprites and how to build scenes.

### Day 77 - 16 Apr 2022

Still in the world of Phaser, today I covered simple player movement and object collisions to finish building a simple frogger style game. I also received a handy little certificate from Zenva for my efforts too!

### Day 78 - 17 Apr 2022

I'm continuing to learn more about more about the Phaser game engine by working through Zenva's [HTML5 Game Development Mini-Degree](https://academy.zenva.com/course/intro-html5-game-development-mini-degree/). I signed up to a 1-month trial of Zenva so I need to try to complete as many of their modules as possible!

### Day 79 - 18 Apr 2022

Two modules down in the Zenva HTML5 game dev mini-degree, the next project will see me building a language learning game.

### Day 80 - 19 Apr 2022

I had a lot of game jam results arrive back recently. I'm interested to see if I'm progressing as a game developer so I've started plotting my results using the d3.js library.
