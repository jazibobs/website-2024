This is my second post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 11 to 20.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 11 - 9 Feb 2022

After building a simple Android shooter game using Godot last week, I thought I would challenge myself to build a simple online multiplayer game. I spent today working through an excellent tutorial by [Game Development Center](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClseGZiVmeHamsjYmpbiAmQ) on YouTube and got simple client and server projects up and running.

[Watch the tutorial by Game Development Center here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnFN6YabFKg)

### Day 12 - 10 Feb 2022

I continued work on my multiplayer Godot projects, today I learnt about [sending messages between client and server (and vise-versa) using RPCs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html#rpc) as well as how to better structure persistent data for my projects using the [Singletons design pattern](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.html).

[Learn more by checking out the Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html)

### Day 13 - 11 Feb 2022

Learnt about building drag and drop user interfaces using Godot, many thanks for [Bramwell Williams](https://twitter.com/bramreth) for providing and excellent tutorial about this on YouTube.

### Day 15 - 13 Feb 2022

Took some time to review my Python knowledge by completing all of the coursework on the Scientific Computing with Python module on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

### Day 16 - 14 Feb 2022

As part of my professional development with Dulwich College Beijing, I've been enrolled in Intel's AI4Youth program to cover ways of better embedding AI within the computer science curriculum. Looking forward to exploring more of the course in the coming days.

### Day 17 - 15 Feb 2022

I spent some time creating a web development project for work as they are in the midst of a minor re-brand. All staff will require a new email signature so I'm creating an email signature builder so I have an excuse to explore working with Vue3.

### Day 18 - 16 Feb 2022

Back with the fine people of Intel this evening learning more about the AI4Youth program. This evening's session covered building simple image classifiers using OpenCV.

### Day 19 - 17 Feb 2022

Spent more time working on my email signature builder started earlier in the week. I added the ability for staff members to add logos of their external EdTech credentials in additional to building a dark mode previewer.

### Day 20 - 18 Feb 2022

Friday night with the team at Intel for AI4Youth. Natural language processing was the focus of the evening which saw us build some simple ChatBox applications.
