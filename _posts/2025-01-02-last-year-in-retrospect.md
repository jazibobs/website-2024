Posted for personal accountability. Hopefully all of these tasks will be completed by December!

Goals for 2025:

- Successfully re-establish my web development business after a 7-year power gap in China.
- Work on something game development related for at least 1 hour per day. Keep me honest by checking: https://dailydev.jaredrigby.co.uk/
- Get [Mithra](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705650/Mithra/) ready for its full release along with the rest of the [Seventh Disorder](https://seventhdisorder.com/) crew
- Help [EiM](https://www.eimglobal.com/) and [Ubisoft Shanghai](https://www.ubisoft.com.cn/) to deliver the 2025 edition of the Dulwich Game Jam.
- Release a new game project as a solo developer on Steam - full release, not Early Access!
- Complete a complete redevelopment of [Taughtly](https://taughtly.co.uk/) with Sarah
