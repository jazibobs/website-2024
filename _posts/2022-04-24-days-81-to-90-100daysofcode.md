This is my ninth post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 81 to 90.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 82 - 21 Apr 2022

Currently working through Zenva academy's HTML5 game development course. Today I completed a small prototype of a flashcard game for language learning.

[The project is available on CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/jazibobs/pen/LYeoRgL)

### Day 87 - 26 Apr 2022

Continuing with Zenva's HTML5 game development courses, I started work on their Express.js API programming module which will I hope will teach me how to create online leader boards for future games.

### Day 88 - 27 Apr 2022

Completed the Express.js course on Zenva. Honestly not as in-depth as I would have hoped. I'll still need to spend some time reading through the Passport.js documentation to learn more about SSO best practices.

### Day 89 - 28 Apr 2022

Back in the world of Phaser for the next part of the Zenva HTML5 game programming course. I learnt about building user interfaces, managing scenes and how to build a pre-loader for games.

[I also received another lovely certificate](https://academy.zenva.com/certificate/07801c9b7067)

### Day 90 - 29 Apr 2022

Working on the final Phaser project from the Zenva HTML5 game programming course. I'll be learning about their in-build physics system to build a simple platformer based on Donkey Kong.
