This is my third post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 21 to 30.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 21 - 19 Feb 2022

I started this block of learning back on Hack the Box academy. I returned to their course about fuzzing web servers and learnt more about performing how to discover endpoints on websites using `ffuf`.

### Day 22 - 20 Feb 2022

I completed the Intel AI4Youth program, I spent this final session planning on how to better embed AI within the curriculum at work and looking at some examples of previous student projects.

### Day 23 - 21 Feb 2022

I've decided to spend some time working through parts of the JavaScript curriculum on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as I don't get much of a chance to use JavaScript day to day. My first focus will be completing the data visualization with D3 module.

[freeCodeCamp - Data Visualization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/)

### Day 24 - 22 Feb 2022

Started work on the first major project for the D3 module on freeCodeCamp, I will be building a bar chart that tracks US GPD over time.

### Day 25 - 23 Feb 2022

Continued to work on the bar chart project, was able to import all data, set up data axes and create dynamic tooltips which overlay important data when a user hovers over a bar on the chart.

### Day 26 - 24 Feb 2022

Spent some more time fixing issues with my first D3 project for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), hoping to have 14/14 passing unit tests by the end of the evening.

### Day 27 - 25 Feb 2022

Completed the first D3 project for my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) data visualization unit. The completed codepen can be seen below:

### Day 30 - 28 Feb 2022

Made a start on the third D3 project for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). A heatmap tracking the variance of the earths temperature over a period of a couple hundred years. The dataset can be found here:
