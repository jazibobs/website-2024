Hello! I'm Jared Rigby, a creative programmer with a love for building innovative solutions.

I have a background in software development and technology education. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and continuously learning new skills. 

Whether it's developing web applications, exploring machine learning, or creating indie games, I strive to create solutions that will delight end-users.

Away from my laptop, you can find me playing football, adding to my record collection or spending time with my partner Sarah.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredgrigby) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/jazibobs).

Let's build something amazing together!
